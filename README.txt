Open program with Microsoft Visual Studio.
Run file. See simulation

code written my Lane Hallock and Peter Kennedy


put input into the input file in the input file as follows:
<# of instructions>
<# of clock cycles to simulate>
<<Opcode> <Destination> <SrcA> <SrcB>>
//other instructions
<R0 initial value>
<R1 initial value >
<R2 initial value>
<R3 initial value >
<R4 initial value>
<R5 initial value >
<R6 initial value>
<R7 initial value >

all values should be integers

after changing the input.txt file save it and run
the main.cpp code

opcodes of -1 in the rs mean no code has been input

0 in the RAT means that it is open

zeroes in the qi qk zi zk initalized so there is no error with output

**running on other platforms should work as long as input.txt is in the same folder as Main.cpp
